# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday, August 24, 2017 

This weeks challenge is to write your own quantum algorithm in Python using IBM's API. See this [top](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-easiest-quantum-algorithm-to-learn-about-for-beginners) answer for some examples of the kind of algorithm you can build. Bonus points for good documentation. Good luck!

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/LhtnECml-KI) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. It build the [Deutsch-Josza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) algorithm using IBM's Quantum API to demonstrate quantum power. 

## Dependencies 

Use [this](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-api-py) README for instructions on how to setup your dependencies 

## Usage
 
Run `python demo.py` in terminal after setting up your dependencies

## Credits 

The credits for this code go to IBM. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
